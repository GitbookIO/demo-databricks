# Get started: Account and workspace setup

If you’re new to Databricks, you’ve found the place to start. This article walks you through the minimum steps required to create your account and get your first workspace up and running.

For information about online training resources, see Get free Databricks training.

### Requirements

To use your Databricks account on AWS, you need an existing AWS account. If you don’t have an AWS account, you can sign up for an AWS Free Tier account at [https://aws.amazon.com/free/](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).

### Step 1: Sign up for a free trial

You can sign up for your free Databricks trial either on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-wtyi5lgtce6n6) or through the [Databricks website](https://databricks.com/try-databricks). The only difference between the two is where you’ll handle the account billing after the free trial ends.

For detailed instructions on the free trial and billing, see Databricks free trial.

### Step 2: Create and set up your first Databricks workspace

After you sign up for the free trial, you’re prompted to set up your first workspace using the AWS Quick Start. This deployment method creates Databricks-enabled AWS resources for you so you can get your workspace up and running quickly.

For instructions on deploying your workspace and basic set up, see Get started: Databricks workspace onboarding.
