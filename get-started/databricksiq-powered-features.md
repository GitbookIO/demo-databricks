# DatabricksIQ-powered features

This page provides information about the DatabricksIQ-powered features that can make your work in Databricks more efficient. These features include Databricks Assistant for help with coding and creating dashboards, automatically generated table documentation in Catalog Explorer, and help in the workspace.

### What is DatabricksIQ?

DatabricksIQ is the data intelligence engine powering the Databricks Platform. It is a compound AI system that combines the use of AI models, retrieval, ranking, and personalization systems to understand the semantics of your organizationâ€™s data and usage patterns.

DatabricksIQ itself has no end-user UI, but it enables existing product experiences to be more accurate and provide more relevant results such as Databricks Assistant, AI-generated comments, and [intelligent search](about:blank/search/index.html#intelligent-search).

These DatabricksIQ-powered features enable everyone in an organization to be more productive using data and AI, while maintaining the governance and controls established in Unity Catalog.
