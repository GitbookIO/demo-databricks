# Databricks data engineering

Databricks data engineering features are a robust environment for collaboration among data scientists, data engineers, and data analysts. Data engineering tasks are also the backbone of [Databricks machine learning](broken-reference) solutions.

Note

If you are a data analyst who works primarily with SQL queries and BI tools, you might prefer Databricks SQL.

The data engineering documentation provides how-to guidance to help you get the most out of the Databricks collaborative analytics platform. For getting started tutorials and introductory information, see [Get started: Account and workspace setup](broken-reference) and [What is Databricks?](broken-reference).
